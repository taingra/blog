Hello stranger! You have reached my personal blog on which you should
expect to find (hopefully) helpfully tutorials on things about and
related to free open source software. GNU/Linux, free culture, and
using free as in freedom tools to get things done. 

All the text on this blog is freely redistributable under the terms of
the [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/][Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC

share them if you so wish!  So long as I am credited as the original
author and you do not revoke these freedoms from anyone else.

I write these posts in a markup language called Org-mode which was
originally made for Emacs but has since been re-implemented in other
editors as well (albeit more limited). You can view the source code on
