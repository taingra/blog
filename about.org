Hello stranger! You have reached my personal blog on which you should
expect to find (hopefully) helpfully tutorials on things about and
related to free open source software, free culture, and using libre
tools to get things done.

so wish!  So long as I am credited as the original author and you
share your content as well. I write these posts in a markup language
called Org-mode which was originally made for Emacs but has since been
re-implemented in other editors as well (albeit more limited). You can
