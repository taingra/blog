#+TITLE: Lightweight Emacs-like Editors
#+DATE: [2020-08-18 Tue]

*Note*: Some information may be out of date.

GNU Emacs is an excellent editor thanks in large part to the power of lisp as an
extension language. It is the extensibility of Emacs that allows for total
customization and excellent packages like [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]], [[https://magit.vc/][magit]], [[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][helm]], and [[https://melpa.org/][many
more]]. That power comes at a cost, slow start up times and a reasonable memory
footprint. You'll rarely find GNU Emacs pre-installed on most Linux distros,
especially not in low-resource environments.

What is an Emacs user to do, assuming you don't want to use vi, the best
option is to utilize Emacs editors with a lighter feel. So consider giving one
of these lightweight Emacs alternatives a try.

* JED
  #+caption: JED showing off split windows, UTF-8 support, and syntax highlighting

  - *Website*: https://www.jedsoft.org/jed/index.html
  - *License*: GPLv2+
  - *Depends on*: libc, slang, slsh, and libgpm

  JED is a powerful editor in near competition with GNU Emacs. JED is written in
  a combination of C and the S-Lang scripting language for which JED is the
  flagship application. JED ships with *UTF-8 support* and *syntax highlighting*
  along with language specific modes for many popular programming languages.

  By default JED uses keybindings very similar to Emacs with extra commands
  available from ~M-x~. There are familiar extras like =compile=, =info=, and a
  =shell=, there's even a mail reader. JED can be configured *and extended* with
  S-Lang making it more flexible and Emacs-like than others on this list.

  JED has not had a stable release in over ten years, however, JED is actively
  developed and the [[https://www.jedsoft.org/snapshots/][latest development snapshot]] is only a few months old.

* JOE --- Joe's Own Editor
  #+caption: JOE's default jmacs config showing off syntax highlighting
  [[file:files/joe-jmacs.png]]

  - *Website*: https://joe:editor.sourceforge.io/
  - *License*: GPLv2
  - *Depends on*: libc, ncurses, terminfo

  #+begin_quote
  JOE is a blending of MicroPro's venerable microcomputer word processor
  WordStar and Richard Stallman's famous LISP based text editor GNU-EMACS [...]:
  most of the basic editing keys are the same as in WordStar as is the overall
  feel of the editor. JOE also has some of the key bindings and many of the
  powerful features of EMACS.
  #+end_quote

  The defaults of JOE may be closer to WordStar than Emacs, but that's no
  problem as JOE provides a number of different configurations. One specifically
  made to emulate the /feel/ of Emacs is aliased to =jmacs=. This scheme matches
  GNU Emacs keybindings with movement, find and replace, transpose, undo,
  etc. all in their usual places.

  In addition, JOE provides extra niceties like *syntax highlighting* and *UTF-8
  support*. You can run a shell with ~F3~, or compile and grep within JOE using
  familiar ~M-x~ commands.

* GNU Zile --- Zile Implements Lua Editors
  #+caption: Zile's default Zemacs editor opening a file in GNOME Terminal
  [[file:files/zile.png]]

  - *Website*: https://www.gnu.org/software/zile/
  - *Repository*: https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/zile/
  - *License*: GPLv3
  - *Depends on*: libc, libacl, libgc, ncurses, and terminfo

  GNU Zile began as an attempt to make a lightweight Emacs editor (its original
  acronym was "Zile Is Lossy Emacs"). It has expanded to be a toolkit for
  implementing small editors with C and Lua. Regardless of this change of scope
  its stock editor is still one of the better imitations of GNU Emacs available.

  #+begin_quote
  [Zile] comes with an example implementation of a lightweight Emacs clone,
  called Zemacs. Every Emacs user should feel at home with Zemacs. Zemacs is
  aimed at small footprint systems and quick editing sessions (it starts up and
  shuts down instantly).
  #+end_quote

  Zemacs looks and feels very similar to running GNU Emacs from the terminal,
  even sporting the familiar modeline. The similarities go deeper as Zemacs is
  self-documenting editor with help pages for commands, variables, and
  keybindings that can be read with the usual Emacs commands (~C-h f~, ~C-h v~,
  and ~C-h k~). Zemacs is configured in its own lisp with syntax like a stripped
  down version of Emacs Lisp. You cannot define new functions, but you can set
  variables and keybindings.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key "key" 'func)

  ; Column beyond which automatic line-wrapping should happen.
  (setq fill-column 80)
  #+end_src

  Out of the box Zemacs has most of the basic editing commands of GNU Emacs and
  supports multiple buffers/windows. It lacks richer features like UTF-8, syntax
  highlighting, or language modes other than fundamental. Zile acknowledges this
  and recommends using Emacs or JED if you need those powerful features.

  For more information check out [[https://www.gnu.org/software/zile/][Zile's website]] and on your system look at
  =zile(1)= and =/usr/share/doc/zile/=.


* Mg --- Micro GNU/emacs
  #+caption: Mg opening a file in GNOME Terminal
  [[file:files/mg.png]]

  - *Repository*:  https://github.com/hboetes/mg
  - *License*:  Permissive
  - *Depends on*: libc, libbsd, and terminfo

  Mg is a lightweight Emacs-like editor maintained by OpenBSD developers and
  included in their base operating system. Mg strives to specifically emulate
  GNU Emacs, so users should feel particularly at home.

  #+begin_quote
  This program is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for people
  who can't (or don't want to) run real Emacs for one reason or another.  It is
  compatible with GNU because there shouldn't be any reason to learn more than
  one Emacs flavor. --- Mg's README
  #+end_quote

  Mg is extensively documented, like most OpenBSD tools, within its manual page
  =mg(1)=. Keybindings with their assigned functions names are all listed and
  every functions' behavior is documented in detail.  Mg supports a wide breadth
  of Emacs editing commands, you can compile files within mg, and even view
  directories with dired (a feature absent from other editors on this
  list). There is only one specific language mode included, =c-mode=, which adds
  some indenting help but no syntax highlighting. Mg also supports ctags and
  cscope to help navigate through large code base.

  Configuration for mg is done with a plain text file that looks like elisp but
  with all the lispy elements stripped out. From this any key can be rebound and
  settings can be adjusted (example taken from the mg manual):

  #+begin_src
  global-set-key ")" self-insert-command
  global-set-key "\^x\^f" find-file
  global-set-key "\e[Z" backward-char
  set-default-mode fill
  set-fill-column 72
  auto-execute *.c c-mode
  #+end_src

  For the most part mg strikes a good balance between minimal and feeling close
  to GNU Emacs. The most obvious downsides of mg is its lack of UTF-8 support.

* e3
  #+caption: e3 running from the =e3em= command showing its help screen
  [[file:files/e3em-help.png]]
  - *Website*: https://sites.google.com/site/e3editor/
  - *License*: GPLv2
  - *Depends on*: (nothing)

  e3 is perhaps the most lightweight editor on this list, it has the smallest
  install size at 121 kilobytes, is written completely in x86 assembly, and has
  absolutely has no dependencies (not even libc). Yet somehow e3 manages to pack
  in an editor with 5 different keybinding schemes (e3em for Emacs), an inline
  calculator, and even *UTF-8 support*! Each editor has a built in help page and
  its own manual page containing a list of keybindings for each editor.

  That being said the imitation the of Emacs only supports the basic Emacs
  editing keybindings. E3 does not support any type of configuration file so you
  have to work with what you're given unless you want to edit some assembly
  code. The other downside of assembly means you are mostly limited to x86
  architecture (e.g. no Raspberry Pi etc.). Still e3's feature set is extremely
  impressive for its size.

* uEmacs
  #+caption: uEmacs built from source running in GNOME Terminal
  [[file:files/uemacs.png]]
  - *Repository*: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/editors/uemacs/uemacs.git/
  - *License*: Shared source with non-commercial redistribution only
  - *Depends on*: libc, curses or termcap

  uEmacs is the personal editor of Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux and Git. It
  is a fork of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroEMACS][MicroEmacs]] 3.9e that Torvalds has added number of improvements to
  over the years. Most notably the addition of *UTF-8 support*.

  It's unlikely there are many users outside of Torvalds. Its existence is not
  well advertised and the license restrictions impede uEmacs from be packaged by
  most Linux distros. Despite that, uEmacs is actively maintained, very small,
  and supports UTF-8, so for those who need international language support it
  could be a viable option.

* GNU Emacs

  [[file:files/gnu-emacs-nw.png]]

  Now that you have seen the many options available for lightweight Emacs
  lookalikes, its time to ask yourself why are you looking for an Emacs
  replacement? Is it simply because Emacs starts to slow or just /"feels too
  heavy"/ for a quick edit. If you don't have a hardware constraint then why
  limit yourself to an inferior editing experience when good ol' GNU Emacs could
  work for you.

  The following options could help to make Emacs feel snappier for that quick
  edit:

  - Run Emacs without a config: =emacs -Q=
  - Run Emacs with a shorter config: =emacs -Q -l ~/.emacs.d/quick.el=
  - Run Emacs as a background daemon and edit using: =emacsclient=
  - Run Emacs within the terminal: =emacs -nw= or =emacsclient -nw=

  Using any of these options or a combination can make GNU Emacs /feel/ as fast
  a lightweight editor. Alias these options to an easy to use command like =qe=:

  #+begin_src bash
  alias qe='emacs -Q -nw -l ~/.emacs.d/quick.el'
  alias ec='emacsclient -nw'
  #+end_src

  If you want to use these options from graphical apps like your file manager
  you can create a .desktop file with these options.

** Remote Editing
   Spare yourself from needed to use an editor on a remote system by using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][TRAMP]]
   to edit remote files from within your local Emacs session. You can open a
   remote file like any other file in Emacs with this special format:

   #+begin_src
   C-x C-f /ssh:username@example.com:~/Documents/somefile.txt
   #+end_src

* Honorable Mentions :noexport:
** Jove --- Jonathan's Own Version of Emacs
   Jove is intended to be a lightweight Emacs editor similar to Gosling Emacs
   without a lisp extension language. Jove has not had a new release since 2010,
   but despite that it is still packaged in some Linux distros. Jove also lacks
   UTF-8 support.

   - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOVE][Jove - Wikipedia]]

** Vile
   Vile is an editor intended to bring together the best of both Emacs and
   Vi. Keybinding wise it is akin to vi editors than Emacs ones.
