#+TITLE: Getting Started with Watchy
#+OPTIONS: tasks:nil

I've recently received my [[https://www.crowdsupply.com/sqfmi/watchy][Watchy]], an open source E-Ink watch, and have
just started to crack the surface of what can be done with the
device. This post outlines how to get going with Watchy from the
perspective of someone who has done very little with Arduino and
hardware programming.

Tested on Debian Sid, steps should be similar across
distributions. Recently moved to Fedora and will be testing shortly.

* Setup

On Debian install the following:

#+begin_src bash
  sudo apt install arduino python3-pyserial
#+end_src

To access the serial connection necessary for uploading to your device
you'll need to add yourself to the =dialout= group.

#+begin_src sh
  sudo adduser $USER dialout
#+end_src

You will need to log out and back in for the change to take full
effect. You can check whether you are in the =dialout= group with:
#+begin_src sh
  groups $USER
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: thomas : thomas dialout cdrom floppy sudo audio dip video plugdev netdev bluetooth lpadmin scanner

** Arduino Setup

With Arduino IDE open there is some hardware setup and libraries that
still need to be setup.  The following steps are outlined in the
[[https://github.com/sqfmi/Watchy][Watchy README.md]].

1. Add [[https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md][ESP32 Boards]]
   1) *File* >> *Preferences*
   2) In *Additional Boards Manager URLs* paste in
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

2. Import the Watchy Library
   1) *Tools* >> *Manage Libraries*
   2) Search Watchy click install
         [[../img/arduino-watchy-library.png]]

3. Hardware Settings
   1) Set Board to "ESP32 Dev Module"
      *Tools* >> *Board* >> *ESP32 Arduino* >> *ESP32 Dev Module*

   2) Set Partition Scheme to "Minimal SPIFFS"
      *Tools* >> *Partition Scheme* >> *Minimal SPIFFS*

* Getting Started

With the setup complete you should be all set to get started working
on a watch face. The Watchy library provides a number of example faces
from which you can use as a basis for your own.  Open an example watch
face *File* >> *Watchy* >> *WatchFaces*.  So far I've found =7_SEG= to be a
good starter for learning, but you should feel free to try out all
options.

A basic change you can make to see if things are working is to swap
the =7_SEG= color scheme by changing line 3 of =Watchy_7_SEG.cpp= to
false.

#+begin_src C
  #define DARKMODE false
#+end_src

Then verify your project with the Check ✓ icon.  If it succeeds plug
in your Watchy to your computer via USB and click Upload.  You'll
likely need to confirm your device (something like =/dev/ttyUSB0= on
Linux), then after a few seconds you should see your watchface invert
colors.

* TODO Emacs Setup

Now that I had things working before I started tweaking too hard I'd
like to get out of the Arduino IDE and back to Emacs. The

https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile

#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt install arduino-mk
#+end_src

#+begin_src makefile
  BOARD_TAG = uno
  ARDUINO_LIBS = Watchy
  MONITOR_PORT = /dev/ttyUSB0
  include /usr/share/arduino/Arduino.mk
#+end_src

* Issues

I had an issue while building the watchface in Arduino where =python=
could not be found because Debian testing does not currently have a
=python= symlink. I had python3 installed so I added one as follows:

#+begin_src bash
  ln -s /bin/python3 ~/bin/python
#+end_src

~/bin= the default location for user scripts in Debian's bash
=.profile=. It will automatically add this directory to the path if it
exists so no additional configuration is needed.  However, if you had
to create this directory you may need to log out and back in for it to
take full effect.

For other distros you may need to add =~/bin= to your =.profile= or
=.bash_profile=

#+begin_src bash
  # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
  if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
      PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
  fi
#+end_src

* Updates

Watchy is a neat little toy and it's crazy you can pack this much
stuff in for $50 USD.  Although, I would have preferred something more
expensive if that meant it was a more polished product.  As someone
who is not /that/ interested with tinkering with electronics I found
the overall package too clunky to actually use and wear.

The final nail in the coffin was when, within my first couple weeks of
use, I accidentally snapped one of the plastic buttons
([[https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Tactile-Switches_Korean-Hroparts-Elec-K2-1114SA-A4SW-06_C136662.html][K2-1114SA-A4SW-06]]).  I just don't have enough enthusiasm about the
device to go through the hassle of repairing that.
