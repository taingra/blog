#+TITLE: Fixing Dell XPS 13 Audio Popping
#+TAGS: xps, linux, tlp, laptop

The Dell XPS 13 has been my primary computer for the past couple
months. It has worked great but recently I noticed some audio
crackling when starting/stopping videos and music playback.

* Solution
I [[http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3517/t/20006160][found the problem]] was an issue with =tlp= a fantastic little tool
that helps save power on Linux laptops. Issue was it was cutting power
to my audio jack when not in use which caused the loud crackling when
it was turned on and off.

** Check if tlp is running
Run the command
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results text verbatim
systemctl status tlp
#+END_SRC

Example output:
#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
‚óè tlp.service - TLP system startup/shutdown
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/tlp.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

#+end_example

In the output you should see the 3rd line "=Active: active=" if =tlp=
is running. Otherwise this solution likely won't fix your problem.

** Edit your tlp config

To solve this edit =/etc/default/tlp= (for beginners use "=gksudo
gedit /etc/default/tlp=" or "=sudo nano /etc/default/tlp=").

Change lines:
#+BEGIN_SRC conf
SOUND_POWER_SAVE_ON_AC=0
SOUND_POWER_SAVE_ON_BAT=1
#+END_SRC
To this:
#+BEGIN_SRC conf
SOUND_POWER_SAVE_ON_AC=0
SOUND_POWER_SAVE_ON_BAT=0
#+END_SRC
Then restart your computer.

That will stop =tlp= from turning your audio on and off when audio
stops playing. You may loose some slight power savings, but I haven't
noticed anything significant. So it's worth doing just to ditch the
annoying crackling!

* Update: Headphone Audio Whining

Recently I have noticed a consistent whining when using headphones. The [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_XPS_13_(9350)#Sound%5D%5D][Arch
Wiki provides a solution]] that seems to work:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
amixer -c 0 cset 'numid=10' 1
#+END_SRC
