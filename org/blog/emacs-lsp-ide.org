#+TITLE: Building Your Own Emacs IDE with LSP

When it comes to programming there is a lot of options around how you choose to
code. None is perhaps as personal as your [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors][choice of editor]]. Among editors Emacs
is one that has stood the test of time and continued to grow in its capabilities
throughout the over 30 years it has existed. It is a tool that can last with you
for a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VADudzQGvU8][lifetime]]. However, Emacs does have limitations when compared to the power
offered by a language specific integrated development environment (IDE). For
Emacs to be able to provide such language specific features requires an in-depth
understanding of every programming language it is working with. That means that
each programming language needs its own set of plugins, duplicating effort
across languages and also editors.

* Enter the Language Protocol Server
  The [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/][Language Server Protocol (LSP)]] is an open standard that strives to solve
  this redundancy. Developed by Microsoft for Visual Studio Code editor, it
  works by creating a standard communication method for your editor to talk
  directly with programming tools. Allowing for features like auto complete,
  jump to definition, find all references, lookup documentation, and error
  warnings. This reduces wasted work as an editor needs only to implement an LSP
  plugin to support all programming languages.

** LSP and Emacs
   With Emacs being the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/]["extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor,"]]
   there have always been ways to get IDE-like features in Emacs. LSP
   differentiates itself by requiring less heavy lifting from Emacs, and current
   Emacs LSP implementation take advantage of many built-in features and well
   established Emacs packages[fn:1].

   | Feature             | Package  | Issues in the past                 |
   |---------------------+----------+------------------------------------|
   | syntax checking     | flymake  | limited language support           |
   | jump to definition  | xref     | requires generating tags           |
   | auto completion     | company* | needs back-ends for every language |
   | argument suggestion | eldoc    | needs packages for other languages |

   \ast{} = must be installed from ELPA (the official Emacs package repository).

   The benefits of this is you can simplify your Emacs configuration and use
   fewer external packages. In fact the development of the LSP has spurred on
   development in several existing Emacs features like flymake and the built in
   json decoder added in Emacs 27.

** Emacs LSP Client Implementations
   In LSP terms you have a language specific server that runs in the background
   and a client that connects to it from your chosen editor. For Emacs LSP
   clients there are two competing packages, both attempt to support as many LSP
   features as possible.

   - *[[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][Eglot]]* has a focus on minimalism, performance, and has the added benefit
     it /could/ one day be included into Emacs[fn:3]. For that reason it is also
     already included in the official Emacs package archive ELPA.

   - *[[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]]* targets universal support of as many additional features and
     packages possible. There are a large number of lsp-mode extensions
     providing additional features. Most packages beginning with "lsp-" are
     lsp-mode specific and will not work with eglot. lsp-mode also has a
     dap-mode package allowing it to work with debuggers that support the Debug
     Adapter Protocol.

   Today we will be using lsp-mode as it is slightly easier setup and is
   currently has more active development.

* Installation
  The easiest way to install lsp-mode is through the built in Emacs package
  manager. First we need to add [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]], a community maintained Emacs package
  repository, by adding the following to your [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html][init file]]:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'package)
    (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
    (package-initialize)
  #+end_src

  Then refresh your package list by typing[fn:2]:

  ~M~-~x~ =package-refresh-contents=

  Now we can install with:

  ~M~-~x~ =package-install= ~RET~ =lsp-mode=

  I wanted drop down auto-completion so I installed [[https://company-mode.github.io/][company]] as well:

  ~M~-~x~ =package-install= ~RET~ =company=

** Configuration
   Here is a very minimal configuration with lsp-mode with company, add it to
   your init file as well:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (require 'lsp-mode)

     ;; Start lsp when you open a file for each langauge
     (add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'lsp)
     (add-hook 'go-mode-hook     #'lsp)
     ;; Add more languages as needed
   #+end_src

   lsp-mode will handle starting all the other [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Minor-Modes.html][minor modes]] necessary. One tweak
   to the defaults I made is changing the amount of documentation lsp-mode shows
   when your cursor rests on a function.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; Show all documenttion
     (setq lsp-eldoc-render-all t)
   #+end_src

*** use-package
    If you are using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], which can help simplify package configuration,
    check out the [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/blob/master/README.org#use-package][example configuration listed in lsp-mode's readme]].

** Installing Language Servers
   A language server is the brains behind all of the LSP features we have
   discussed, your experience will only be as good as the server you use. It is
   important to highlight that the LSP is a relatively new technology and not
   every programming language has a robust server implement just yet.

   lsp-mode maintains [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode#supported-languages][a list of supportted language servers]] that should work
   automatically. More language servers can be found on [[https://langserver.org/][langserver.org]]. Two I
   have experimented with are [[https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls][gopls]] and [[https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server][pyls]] for GoLang and Python
   respectively. A nice feature of these particular language servers is they can
   be installed using their language specific package tools. For example, gopls
   is installed with:

   #+begin_src bash
     go get golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
   #+end_src

   and pyls with:

   #+begin_src bash
     pip install ‘python-language-server[all]’
   #+end_src

   Make sure that wherever your language server is installed it is reachable
   from your *$PATH*. You can test this by running the language server command,
   for most servers it should run and do nothing. Just make sure you don't get
   =bash: gopls: command not found...=

* Using LSP
  Once you've got your language server open any file on one of your projects and
  you will be greeted with the following message:

  #+begin_src
  foo.py is not part of any project. Select action:

  i==>Import project root /home/name/Projects/FooBar/.
  I==>Import project by selecting root directory interactively.
  d==>Do not ask for the current project by adding /home/name/Projects/FooBar/. to lsp-session-folders-blacklist.
  D==>Do not ask again for current project by selecting ignore path interactively.
  n==>Do nothing: ask again when opening other files from the current project.
  #+end_src

  The options should be pretty self explanatory, use *i* if the given root is
  correct, *I* if the root needs to be adjusted (e.g. you are in a
  subdirectory). You should only use *d* and *D* for project you do not wish to
  use lsp-mode's project management features.

  Now you are good to code. lsp-mode will have automatically started the
  necessary modes:

  - *company* will provide auto complete suggestions,
  - *flymake* will highlight warnings and errors,
  - *xref* can find the definition of a function or variable, and
  - *eldoc* will show function documentation in the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Minibuffer.html][minibuffer]].

  By default ~M~-~.~ will jump to definition of a highlighted
  function or variable.

* Conclusion
  Overall with this basic LSP setup and a few other packages ([[https://magit.vc/][magit]], [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][yasnippets]],
  [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens]], and [[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][helm]]) is enough for me to have a comfortable editing
  experience with some niceties of an IDE. In the future I'd like to try out
  Java development using [[https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls][Eclipse's Java language server]], as well compare pyls
  with the [[https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server][Microsoft Python language server]].

  For someone that would like to take this idea further I would suggest you look
  into some of the additional lsp-mode packages ([[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui][lsp-ui]], [[https://github.com/tigersoldier/company-lsp][company-lsp]],
  [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-treemacs][lsp-treemacs]], etc.). Also, you could explore making Emacs look more like a
  modern editor with [[https://emacsthemes.com/][a nice theme]], [[https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline][powerline]], [[https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree][NeoTree]], and [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all-the-icons.el]].

* Possible Issues and Solutions

** Performance
   I have not had any issues with performance on my machine using GNU Emacs 26.3
   with the default setting, however, if issues occur there are [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode#performance][several steps
   you can take to increase performance]].

   Increasing memory limits for Emacs garbage collector and maximum data output
   read from a process:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; Increase garbage collector threshold
     (setq gc-cons-threshold 100000000) ;; 100 MB

     ;; Increase amount of data read from a process
     (setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024)) ;; 1 MB
   #+end_src

   Using an up-to-date Emacs version can work wonders as Emacs 27 has a native
   json parser which is reported to be "~15 times" faster than previous
   versions.

** flymake vs flycheck
   Another issue you may be facing is with flymake, flymake is currently
   undergoing a rewrite to better support modern things like the LSP. Some of
   that rewrite has made it into Emacs 26 and some is still to come in 27. If
   you are using an older Emacs version, or having other issues you could
   install flycheck a popular third-party alternative to flymake.

   If you are using flymake on the latest Emacs version consider [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Bugs.html][filing a bug
   report]] to help with its development.
