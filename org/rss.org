#+TITLE: RSS Feeds

RSS is currently work-in-progress as I am writing my own generator
[[https://git.sr.ht/~taingram/org-publish-auto-rss][org-publish-auto-rss]].  Right now I have a working feed with links to
post that should get automatically updated when I have new blog posts.

- [[https://taingram.org/blog/blog-rss.xml][Blog RSS]]

If you have any issues with this feed please let me know as that will
help fix bugs.

* Project RSS

If you are interested in following along to my projects I would
recommend using the RSS feeds provided by [[https://sourcehut.org/][sourcehut]] log tab.
