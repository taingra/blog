Welcome to my personal website. I am a recent computer science graduate from
Michigan Technological University. I'm interested in [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][Free Software]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]],
computer security, and privacy.

This site is intentionally minimal to show that websites can be pleasant and
functional without a huge footprint. You can [[file:blog/org-mode-blog.org][read about how I built this site
