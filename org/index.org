Welcome to my personal website. I am a recent computer science graduate from
Michigan Technological University. I'm interested in GNU/Linux, computer
privacy, security, and [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][free/libre software]] solutions.

This site, like most I design, is intentionally minimal to show that websites
can be pleasant and functional without a huge footprint. You can [[file:blog/org-mode-blog.org][read about how
I built this site]] and view the source code on [[https://gitlab.com/taingram/blog][GitLab]].

Whenever possible I release my writing and source code under [[https://creativecommons.org/][Creative Commons]] or
