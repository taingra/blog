Welcome to my personal website. I am a computer science student studying at
Michigan Tech, interested in GNU/Linux, computer privacy, security, distributed
systems, and open source software solutions.

functional without a huge footprint. You can [[file:blog/org-mode-blog.org][read about how I built this site]]
