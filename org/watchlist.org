The basis for my rating system is entirely so I can more easily
recommend and find films to rewatch.  They are ranked completely based
on how much I would ever want to rewatch or recommend something.

|---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   | *Plan to Watch*                                                                |
| 1 | *Terrible* --- would not want to rewatch ever                                  |
| 2 | *Bad* --- but had some entertainment value                                     |
| 3 | *Good* --- would recommend to some or rewatch on occasion                      |
| 4 | *Great* --- would recommend and rewatch anytime, but not perfect               |
| 5 | *Perfect* --- recommend everyone see for entertainment value or artistic merit |

My goal is to document what I've watched and enjoyed so that I can
more easily look back and provide recommendations.  With that purpose
in mind it is not a complete list and I may trim entries I deem not
work remembering.

Very good slow space science fiction movie.

I really like these new small budget science fiction movies like
High-Life and Prospect that explore new ideas beyond just showcasing
special effects.  Not to say the special effects are bad, all these
films play to their strengths and look great as well.  Of those movies
this one is definitely the saddest, but also feels like the most real
and grounded.  It's easy to get swept up into the narrative and
characters and be really impacted by the story.

The movie is actually a based on a famous Swedish poem of the same
name by Harry Martinson.  You can read an [[https://gsproject.edublogs.org/gs-texts/texts-used-in-2017/aniara-by-harry-martinson-3/][English translation of the

Great anime, best CGI anime I've seen. I'm very interested in reading

about the horror and alienation immigrants experience, but then it
gets spooky. Honestly, both sides of that were handled very well.  The
supernatural elements did not undermine the main themes.

Definitely watched this before at some point.  Easy fun, and fun
sets.  Nice to see a family movie from before there was a ton of CGI
used.

Having just watched Aniara this week I was looking for something with
a similar vibe.  This definitely fit that, but I feel like my
expectations from Aniara made me enjoy this less.  Where Aniara
waste's no time Melancholia is constantly stopping for the sake of
symbolism.  Still overall a very good movie and I might increase my
rating of it in the future.

One of the most accessible Lars Von Trier movies I've seen.

I really liked Justine's portrayal of depression.  It felt extremely
real and genuine.  However I felt the introduction of her character's
clairvoyance undermined it in the third act.

Good sequel, does things different than the original, but still
manages to maintain tension throughout the movie.  Still an extremely

Definitely the worst of the Hostel movie.  Lacks any of the comedy or
charm of the first two movies.  Less gross than the first two, but
that just adds to the movie being boring.

:END:

It's not as bad as some people say.  At time the effects are quite
interesting to watch like with the anamotric alien head or in the
fantastic surgery scene.  Michael Fassbender steals the show as the
android David, and is great in the sequal as well.  Ultimately its the
inconsistent tone and a plot that feels like it was just written to
justify disjointed action scenes leaves a lot to be desired.

I'll note while Alien (1971) is one of my favorite movies I am not a
purist.  I even like Alien Resurrection.

See my thoughts on [[Midsommer]] they are basically the same opinions.  I
felt like the third act really takes off out of nowhere.

I know a lot of people really like Ari Aster films, but for me they
all just miss.  I don't find the symbolism deep or particularly
interesting.  If anything the messaging at time is too heavy handed.

That being said, Ari Aster does know how to create extremely
interesting and beautiful visuals.  This movie definitely nails that
aspect.

Good set design and effects.  I liked that the buildings felt very
real and also very reminiscent of the spaceship in Alien.

Could have been stupid fun.  Really odd choice making it a movie about
soldiers that are wormholed into the Monster Hunter world.  Also
really lame how little in this movie characters actually hit a monster
with a sword.

* Games :noexport:

** Elden Ring

Soon.

** Super Mario Odyssey
[2022-01-15 Sat]

It's good, it's charming, and it's great for listening to audio books.

** Resident Evil Village
[2021-10-25 Mon]

Pretty good but really peaks at the castle and never quite rises back to that level. Not enough default enemy variety.

** Resident Evil 2
[2021-09-30 Thu]

Really fun quick game. I've never played the original (or any other Resident Evil games) so it was a very fresh and fun experience. Loved the retro puzzle solving and key hunting. Graphics were superb, gore effects were fanatic.

I played through both Claire and Leon's story so I could get the true ending. I'd recommend playing as Claire first then Leon that way you can get used to exploring the police station before getting hunted by Mr. X.

*** Spoilers

I was disappointed that in secret evil lab the escalation from huge
fleshy monsters in the sewers is to lame plant zombies. Now maybe I
have too many house plants, but personally I'm not scared of plants.

** Monster Hunter Rise
[2021-05-10 Mon]

Great iteration on the Monster Hunter formula. I like how the game is
more streamlined than Monster Hunter World. World was my first time
playing the series and I found it a bit overwhelming. Lots of things
that I never used.

Impressive how the graphical downgrade to put Monster Hunter on the
Switch is not that noticeable. Monsters still look fantastic. The only
thing I miss is the insanely confusing maps from World. The maps are
good, but the labyrinthine design of the maps in World made the feel
gigantic.

** Ghost of Tsushima

Beautiful game, pretty good story. The combat is okay, but starts to
get stale towards the end of the game, and its difficult to shake up
as other options like steal are horribly broken.

Lots of cool outfits, but you'll end up only ever wearing the
traveler's outfit 90% of the time as it vibrates your controller when
you are near points of interest/collectibles.

** Dark Souls
