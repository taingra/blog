Good sequel, does things different than the original, but still
manages to maintain tension throughout the movie.  Still an extremely
"indie" feeling movie.

** Prometheus

:END:

It's not as bad as some people say.  At time the effects are quite
interesting to watch like with the anamotric alien head or in the
fantastic surgery scene.  Michael Fassbender steals the show as the
android David, and is great in the sequal as well.  Ultimately its the
inconsistent tone and a plot that feels like it was just written to
justify disjointed action scenes leaves a lot to be desired.

I'll note while Alien (1971) is one of my favorite movies I am not a
purist.  I even like Alien Ressurrection.

Perhaps my favorite film.  Feels extremely relevant every time I watch it.

Only complaint is that scene when that windshield shatters.

** Resident Evil 2

:RATING:   4
:Year:      2019
:Developer: Capcom
:Country:   Japan
:Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_2_(2019_video_game)
:Source:    PS4
:Played:    2021
:GENRE:    Survivial Horror
:END:

Really fun quick game.  I've never played the original (or any other
Resident Evil games) so it was a very fresh and fun experience.  Loved
the retro puzzle solving and key hunting.  Graphics were superb, gore
effects were fanatic.

I played through both Claire and Leon's story so I could get the true
ending.  I'd recommend playing as Claire first then Leon that way you
can get used to exploring the police station before getting hunted by
Mr. X.

*** Spoilers
I was disappointed that in secret evil lab the escalation from huge
fleshy monsters in the sewers is to lame plant zombies.  Now maybe I
have too many house plants, but personally I'm not scared of plants.

** Ghost of Tsushima
:PROPERTIES:
:Rating:    3
:Year:      2020
:Developer: Sucker Punch
:Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_of_Tsushima
:Genre:     Historical Fiction
:Source:    PS4
:END:

Beautiful game, pretty good story.  The combat is okay, but starts to
get stale towards the end of the game, and its difficult to shake up
as other options like steal are horribly broken.

Lots of cool outfits, but you'll end up only ever wearing the
traveler's outfit 90% of the time as it vibrates your controller when
you are near points of interest/collectibles.
