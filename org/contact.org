#+Title: Contact Me

Please contact me over email <[[mailto:comment@taingram.org][comment@taingram.org]]>.  I will generally
respond within a week assuming your message is not spam.

* Social Media

If you use social media I would advise you to please be careful what
information and pictures you post publicly.  Companies and governments
data-mine public websites and social media feeds.  That information is
fed into advertising/police/government databases, facial recognition,
AI models, and more.  Please especially be considerate when posting
photos of others and children as that content will likely exist online
forever.

You can find me very occasionally on [[https://joinmastodon.org/][Mastodon]] in the emacs.ch
instance.  I post mainly about drawing and Emacs.
