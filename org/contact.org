respond within a week assuming your message is not spam.

* Social Media

You can find me very occasionally on [[https://joinmastodon.org/][Mastodon]] in the emacs.ch instance
and on BlueSky.  I post mainly about drawing, coding, and Emacs.

If you use social media I would advise you to please be careful what
information and pictures you post publicly.  Companies and governments
data-mine public websites and social media feeds.  That information is
fed into advertising/police/government databases, facial recognition,
AI models, and more.  Please especially be considerate when posting
photos of others and children as that content will likely exist online
forever.
