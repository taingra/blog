#+Title: Contact Me

Please contact me over email <[[mailto:comment@taingram.org][comment@taingram.org]]>.  I will generally
respond within a week assuming your message is not spam.

* Social Media

If you use social media I would advise you to please be careful what
information and pictures you post publicly.  Companies and governments
data-mine public websites and social media feeds.  That information is
fed into police/government databases, AI models, and more.  Please
especially be considerate when posting photos of others and children
as that content will likely exist online forever.

You can find me on [[https://joinmastodon.org/][Mastodon]] and Twitter.  I post mainly about drawing,
movies, my dogs, and Emacs.  Important posts will be posted to both
platforms.
