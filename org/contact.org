* Social Media

You can find me occasionally on Mastodon and BlueSky.  I post mainly
about drawing, coding, Godot, and Emacs.

** Comments on Social Media
If you use social media I would advise you to please be careful what
information and pictures you post publicly.  Companies and governments
data-mine public websites and social media feeds.  That information is
fed into advertising/police/government databases, facial recognition,
AI models, and more.  Please be considerate when posting photos of
others and especially children as that content will likely exist
online forever.
