#+TITLE: taingram.org Org Source

This is is the Emacs Org mode source that is used to generate the
posts for my blog [[https://taingram.org][taingram.org]].

The goal of this setup was to be able to generate my blog with GNU Emacs and no
additional dependencies. Luckily Org mode provides wonderful exporting and
publishing functionality.

* Building HTML pages
I've provided a makefile for those not experienced with Emacs, running =make= will
generate all the files necessary in the HTML directory.

This is a convenient solution as it does not required publish.el to be loaded
before running, and will not conflict with or override existing Emacs settings.
